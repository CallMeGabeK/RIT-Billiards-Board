You will notice that there are 4 different packages each with a specific purpose.

Repository Layer:
    An abstraction layer responsible for data access operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with the database.

Controller Layer:
    Handles HTTP requests and responses, performs basic validation, and passes data to the service layer.
    It is the entry point for external entities, in our case the REACT application

Service Layer:
    Contains the business logic, performs processing and complex validation, and coordinates interactions
    between different repositories.

Entity/Model Layer:
    Represents the data structure or domain model, defining how data is stored in the database.


To run the spring boot application either:
    run the command "mvn clean spring-boot:run"
    or
    if on intelliJ, navigate to the BackendApplication file and run the program

The easiest way to use the endpoints will be with the Endpoints menu in IntelliJ.
After running the code you chose what command you want to run and what payload to give it.
