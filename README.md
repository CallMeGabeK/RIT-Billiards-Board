# RIT Billiards Board
The RIT Billiards Board is a collaborative project to provide a competitive landscape for RIT billiards players who strive to be one of RIT's best.

## Project Idea: 
Create a leaderboard system so pool players at RIT can compete in a leaderboard format. Players are able to schedule matches with the two people above them and are able to accept challenges from the people below. 
- Players should have a profile which can be viewed by others and hold information such as name, major, apa rank and fargo (if applicable).
- When a player is challenged, they should get a notification – email should work for now – to check the webpage where they can accept the challenge.
- Once the challenge is accepted both players are directed to a page where they can communicate and decide when to play.


## Homepage:
When users visit the website they should see:
- The Leaderboard
    - Maybe show top 10 with an option to add more/add less
    - Rank and Name
- Upcoming Matches
    - Who is playing, what rank they are, and when
